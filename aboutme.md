subtitle: Data Scientist (in training) and Public Health Enthusiast
---

Woman in science doing a small, but related, pivot from public health epi to health data science. I think Colombian food is highly underrated and I love a good sunrise. Dreaming of a world where science trumps politics because, as the great Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson said, the good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it.

### Background
- Bachelor of Art in Biomedical Humanities, Hiram College (2003)
- Master of Science in Public Health, University of Utah (2009)
- Currently pursuing a Master of Health Data Science, Universitat Rovira i Virgili (because apparently, we need to go abroad to learn about proper health now)
